# Templates for manual testing test cases

In the manual testing, test cases are carried out by hand without the aid of an automated tool. The process can be quite challenging at times, so I've developed a repository of manual testing ideas and templates based on real-world experience that can be applied in various contexts.

## :loudspeaker: What this is all about?
To help manual testers write manual test cases faster, this repository includes a sample set of test cases. Additionally, it contains templates for test planning and bug templates.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why was this project started?
Writing test cases is a laborious task that consumes the majority of software testing time. Therefore, I made generic test cases for the functionality that is most frequently used in software testing so that anyone can download a copy and use it immediately in their projects and save the time required to write the generic test cases.


## :bulb: The following additional sample test cases and templates:
- Sample Test cases for some common functionality
- Model Test cases for Test Reports.
- General Test Cases for Login Functions.
